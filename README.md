This project use to showcase my HTML, CSS and JS skills.

## Features of the App

1. Add Tasks
2. Check and Uncheck the Tasks
3. Delete the task
4. Save the task list in the web browser in the local storage

## How to work the app

In this video you will learn to make a To-Do List App or Website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In this To Do list we can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete. We can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We will add a close icon to delete the particular task from the ToDo list.

In this JavaScript Project we are using Local Storage that will store the task list or To Do list in your web browser, So that if you close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved To-Do List
